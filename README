MeTube is a media hosting site similar to YouTube. Users can upload videos, audio, and images, as well as interact with other members of the site. This was a semester long project completed for my CPSC 4620 course at Clemson University

The MeTube_ProjectReport.pdf highlights the core functionalities of the website and the entirety of the development process.
